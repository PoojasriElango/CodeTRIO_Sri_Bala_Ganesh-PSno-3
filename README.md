Description-This finance tracker is designed to help users manage their personal finances with ease. The goal is to enable users to track their income, expenses, and savings, providing a clear overview of their financial health. It helps users organize their finances, set spending limits, and monitor their progress toward savings goals.
Users can either upload a dataset or manually input their financial data. The tracker then processes this information, presenting it visually in the form of graphs and pie charts. These visualizations allow users to easily compare their financial data, helping them spot trends and make more informed financial decisions.
The project simplifies financial tracking by offering users insightful visual comparisons, ensuring they stay on top of their finances and meet their goals efficiently.
